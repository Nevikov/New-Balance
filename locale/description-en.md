# New-Balance

The New Balance makes adjustments to the balance without drastically altering the core gameplay dynamics. The basic structure of the vanilla balance is maintained to ensure general compatibility with all AIs.\
The main goals of this balance are to bridge the gap between European and Arabic units and to make previously underused units like spearmen more viable.\
Most changes are targeted adjustments to units. To ensure the AIs still function properly, the costs of units and buildings remain virtually unchanged.
