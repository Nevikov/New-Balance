# Community Package

The Community Package includes a selection of the finest AIs created by long-standing and renowned AI modders from the Stronghold community.  
All AIs stand out for their high quality: new completely overhauled characters, well-thought-out build orders, and a balanced mix of strength and personality that fits seamlessly into the medieval Stronghold Crusader setting. The characters are especially well-suited for AI battles and also pose a fair challenge as opponents for players.  
The Community Package is managed by me, Nevikov.
